Url Shortener
Let’s create a rails app that shortens urls.

User Story
As a user I should be able to enter a url in a form and receive a shortened url as an integer(id)
When visiting this shortened url I should be redirected to the original url
Example:
- Given a ‘long’ url in the form (https://twitter.com/jciancio7), should generate a shortened url (https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/3)
- When I visit https://YOUR_APP.herokuapp.com/3, I should be redirected to https://twitter.com/jciancio7
